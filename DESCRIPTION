Description: This package loads the output of our single cell allele specific expression (ASE) pipeline (https://github.com/seanken/ASE_pipeline) and tools to perform downstream analysis with it (can also be applied to other ASE pipelines). Built to work with 10X single cell or nucleus data, though can also work with spatial data such as Visium.
